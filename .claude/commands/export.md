# export

Export every record to one JSON file the business owns.

Run `node scripts/cases.mjs export [--out=<file>]`. Add `--json` when you need every field. Resolve the person or case by name first; if the CLI says a name is ambiguous, list the candidates and ask. Replace every angle-bracket value with a fact from the records or the operator. Never run a placeholder.

Show the file path and row counts.
